CLASSES
A Region has name, Alignment, population, wealth, land, sea, taxes, morale, 
owner and production. These parameters give the difficulty of game Session,
e.g. Regions with no owner are harder.  Owner is a Family: Regions may have
a specific one at the start, and they may change later.

Alignment is one in Celts, Norman, Saxon. 
Each gives Player different Skills and has lists of Family, male and female 
names to generate Persons. Each has its own specifics, e.g. Celts hunt with 
a bow, Saxons with spear.

Skills is a collection of levels in strength, charisma, agility, knowledge.
Strength and agility decrease with age; charisma and knowledge increase.
Person's actions may change skills.

Family has name, Title, Alignment and Skills. Skills of ruling Families may
be different from the ones in Alignment. Title is the rank of every Family,
in a hierarchical way. Each Family as a Person as a head, and an insigna.
Insigna has a Shape, a Division and top, bottom and center images.
The Shape contains the Division: it can have one, two or four slices,  each
with an image.

and some relations. Face is the number of the image to show in the Session.
